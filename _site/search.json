This visualization will uncover suspicious activities such as vessel visiting locations not designated for fishing.  By checking the timestamp of these suspicious activities, it is possible to determine when illegal fishing was being performed.  The vessels movement of SouthSeafood Express Corp can be visualized in comparison with other companies in Oceanus to confirm SouthSeafood illegal fishing behaviour.\nReferring to sub-question 1, vessels can be connected to their respective probable cargo. Visualization of SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels and their probable cargo can be compared to that of other companies to determine how does the fishing activity varies.\nOn measure used to describe fishing activity is the relative time spent at respective regions, in comparison to other vessels of similar nature. Filtering the vessel by type (fishing), tonnage and overall length and most frequently visited ports, we can observe the typical behaviour of vessels similar to South Seafood Express. From there, we can compare their relative catch to see if South Seafood Express is able to have higher cargo tonnage at their subsequent port.\n\n4.2.1 Early Prototype for Sub-question 2:\nSouthSeafood Express Corp Vessels Movement\n\nExploring the relative dwell time that SouthSeafood Express Corp Vessels spend at their respective regions in comparison to other vessels.

The company has been summoned multiple times by the cities of Lomark and Himark throughout 2035.\n\n\nKambalaSea Freight Inc.\nOverfishing in the Cod Table, Tuna Shelf, and Wrasse Beds on or around May 1, 2035.\n\n\nKisumuSeafoodBrothers\n\n\n\nLtd.\nOverfishing in Nemo Reef on April 2, 2035.\n\n\n\nDrilling into mini-challenge 2, sub-question 1, the team surfaced challenges mapping the vessels and cargo at each port based on the individual date. As illustrated in the data table below, the count of vessel and cargo at each port on the same date varies.\n\nPossible reason: This may be due to variance in time needed to offload cargo, refuel the ships at the respective ports.\nMoreover, fishing models needs to be considered such as the use of “Transhipment Vessels” where fishing vessel deposit their catch onto cargo vessels with attempt to maximise fishing time in sea.\nReference: https://www.oceansinc.earth/transshipment\nForeseeable challenges include different styles that fishing vessels corporate with cargo vessels. Such as:\n\nSame company owning both fishing vessels and transhipment vessels.\nIndividual fisherman cooperating with larger companies for shipment.\n\nOn improving existing visualisation, to identify the route taken by vessels, the path taken by each vessel will be reordered by date to identify the usual routes taken. Any deviation of fishing route may prompt further investigation. The sailing route will further be transposed on Oceanus map.  \nAction Items:\n\n\n\nAction items\nOwner(s)\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nAgenda for Next Meeting:"

(Red: Illegal, Orange: Legal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nInclude reference on what is the selected fish species for user’s readability.\nInclude details on which port are these cargo delivered to and which months these cargo are delivered on a summary plot.\n\n\n\n\nShiny Plot 4: Vessel dwell time & relative dwell time to other vessels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose & Functionality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Plot 5: Interactive Calendar Heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose & Functionality\n\n\n\nPurpose: Helps user see the seasonality of when cargo reaches the respective ports based on a calendar map\n\nAllows users to compare the cargo count across various port at specific dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nInclude filter to allow users to zoom into selected dates of interest.\nRelabel of the y axis to make it reasonable instead of using count of weeks.\nTo include reference to other data set (e.g., Count of vessels that is at the port, return the breakdown of fish species caught)\n\n\n\n\nShiny Plot 6: Summary of the most frequent route taken by vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose & Functionality\n\n\n\nPurpose: Identifies the most travelled distinct routes by vessel.\n\nAllow users to select areas of interest that they are looking at and count the number of vessel for these top routes.\nAllow users to zoom into specific companies to identify the distinct locations visited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nHighlight routes that have trespass illegal fishing route in “Red”\nHighlight routes that have visited fishing grounds and deep sea fishing navigation buoy in “Dark blue”\nInclude reference to map to plot the geographical route taken on the map.\n\n\n\n\nShiny Plot 7: Box Plot of Cargo Weight by Fish Species by Month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose & Functionality\n\n\n\nPurpose: Helps users to identify which vessel contributes to which cargo and the relative position within the month.\n\nAllows users to drill down into desired fish species\nAllows users to drill down into specific port of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nHandling error where there is no record for that fish species for the given port, to properly return “No Available Record”.\nIntroduce option for user to select color for highlighted vessels (Multiple) to contrast\n\n\n\n\nShiny Plot 8: Median Dwell Time of vessel by Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose & Functionality\n\n\n\nPurpose: Helps users identify the monthly median dwell time of the vessel at the respective area of interest.\n\nAllows users to identify area that they want to contrast to see the median dwell time spent\nAllows users to zoom into specific vessels of interest\nBy hovering on the plot, users are able to see the name of the vessel id contributing to this median dwell time at the area of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nIntroduce filter to identify vessel by company\nIntroduce option for user to select color for highlighted vessels (Multiple) to contrast\nIntroduce reference line that maps the % increase / decrease for month on month median dwell time changes for all vessels & selected vessels.\nIntroduce data table that returns the vessels and their details for those that are included in the “Highlighted Vessel ID”\n\n\n\n\nShiny Plot 9: Route taken by vessels - SOS Myat!\nShiny Plot 10: Dwell time by vessels at the areas visited - SOS Myat!\nShiny Plot 11: Comparison of fish delivered month on month with % change - SOS Myat!\n\nDiscussion on how to combine the r Shiny Plots to address the sub-questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\nPlots and layout\n\n\n\n\nQ1a - Mapping of Cargo Delivered by Vessels\n\nNetwork graph that links cargo to vessel\nQuantity of cargoes received per month\n\n\n\nQ1b - Seasonality\n\n\n\nQ2 - Geographical mapping & dwell time\n\n\n\nQ3 -\n\n\n\n\nAction Items:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction items\nOwner(s)\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\nRefine the r Shiny Plots and document a “User Guide”\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n24 June 2024\n\n\nCombine the r Shiny Plots and introduce links between various plots for coordinated linked view.\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n24 June 2024\n\n\nInvestigate the possible suspicious behaviours with the r Shiny plots and document down findings in “Observations”\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n24 June 2024\n\n\nSummarise the methodology and findings in the poster.\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n24 June 2024\n\n\n\nAgenda for Next Meeting:\n\nReview the refined r Shiny plots & test for instance where there is any errors\nReview the observations and potential finding for concurrence and reasonableness check."
