As illustrated in the data table below, the count of vessel and cargo at each port on the same date varies.\n\nPossible reason: This may be due to variance in time needed to offload cargo, refuel the ships at the respective ports.\nMoreover, fishing models needs to be considered such as the use of “Transhipment Vessels” where fishing vessel deposit their catch onto cargo vessels with attempt to maximise fishing time in sea.\nReference: https://www.oceansinc.earth/transshipment\nForeseeable challenges include different styles that fishing vessels corporate with cargo vessels. Such as:\n\nSame company owning both fishing vessels and transhipment vessels.\nIndividual fisherman cooperating with larger companies for shipment.\n\nOn improving existing visualisation, to identify the route taken by vessels, the path taken by each vessel will be reordered by date to identify the usual routes taken. Any deviation of fishing route may prompt further investigation. The sailing route will further be transposed on Oceanus map.  \nAction Items:\n\n\n\nAction items\nOwner(s)\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nArya, Jing Yi, Myat\n4 June 2024\n\n\n\nAgenda for Next Meeting:"

As majority of the focus for mini-challenge 2 is associated with the mapping of vessels to cargo based on the harbor import report and the vessel movement report, the team decided on the following breakdown.\n\nEveryone to attempt Q1\nFor subsequent questions 2,3,4 this will be split evenly amongst the group mates.\n\nEventual assignment of sub-question is as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-question & key focus\nTeam member\n\n\n\n\nQ1 & Q2 - Understanding South Seafood’s behaviour in terms of locations visited and dwell time to identify areas of suspicious activity.\nMyat\n\n\nQ1 & Q3 - Identifying vessels that have similar patterns to South Seafood and identify if these behaviour are suspicious.\nArya\n\n\nQ1 & Q4 - Comparing the behaviour of vessels before and after South Seafood was caught (i.e., dwell time at various areas, vessel count at each area, cargo count before and after with time series)\nJing Yi\n\n\n\nAgenda for next meeting:\n\nReview the insights derived from each sub-question covered by the team members.\nPreliminary selection of the plots to use for the final project on Shiny.\nReview possible areas of improvement for the plot to improve clarity and make them more aesthetically pleasing."

This visualization will uncover suspicious activities such as vessel visiting locations not designated for fishing.  By checking the timestamp of these suspicious activities, it is possible to determine when illegal fishing was being performed.  The vessels movement of SouthSeafood Express Corp can be visualized in comparison with other companies in Oceanus to confirm SouthSeafood illegal fishing behaviour.\nReferring to sub-question 1, vessels can be connected to their respective probable cargo. Visualization of SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels and their probable cargo can be compared to that of other companies to determine how does the fishing activity varies.\nOn measure used to describe fishing activity is the relative time spent at respective regions, in comparison to other vessels of similar nature. Filtering the vessel by type (fishing), tonnage and overall length and most frequently visited ports, we can observe the typical behaviour of vessels similar to South Seafood Express. From there, we can compare their relative catch to see if South Seafood Express is able to have higher cargo tonnage at their subsequent port.\n\n4.2.1 Early Prototype for Sub-question 2:\nSouthSeafood Express Corp Vessels Movement\n\nExploring the relative dwell time that SouthSeafood Express Corp Vessels spend at their respective regions in comparison to other vessels. (Red: SouthSeafood Express Corp Vessels; Grey: Other vessels)\n(Note: Diagrams below are illustrative, further fine-tuning is required for representative visualization)\n\nAfter mapping the cargo to their probable vessels, we identify the expected catch from vessels that have taken similar routes as South Seafood Express Corp vessels. Comparing the breakdown of their cargo, we should observe that South Seafood Express Corp has more catch from their illegal fishing activities.\n(Note: Diagrams below are illustrative, further fine-tuning is required for representative visualization)"
