This focuses on analyzing ship movements and shipping records to understand illegal fishing practices.\n\n\n\nKey objectives\n\nCreate visualisations to show patterns of ship movements and identify suspicious behaviours.\nUnderstand how commercial fishing community changed after a company was caught fishing illegally.\n\n\n\nReferences\nFor more information on VAST Challenge 2024 Mini-Challenge 2, please visit the official website here."
