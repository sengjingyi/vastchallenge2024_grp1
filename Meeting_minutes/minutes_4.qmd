**Date:** 23/05/2024

**Time:** 10 – 10.30 pm

**Location:** SMU

**Attendees:** Arya Siahaan, Seng Jing Yi, Thet Myat Noe

**Agenda:**

1.  Discussion on dilemma faced during data cleaning for MC2.

2.  Discussion on insights derived from knowledge graphs and other visualisations.

3.  Discussion on details for project proposal.

**Meeting Notes:**

Team discussed the considerations during data cleaning for MC2, ranging from relabelling of columns, removing of duplicates and possible connector for MC2 sub-question 1 on linking cargo_id to vessel_id.

-   **Discussion point #1:** [Aligning of headers and dropping of duplicate columns.]{.underline}

::: callout-tip
## Decision

Identified primary keys to link the “Event” edges with the “Entity” nodes.

1.  Cargo_id between Event. Transaction, Entity.Delivery.Report
2.  Vessel_id between Event.TransponderPing and Event.HaborReport with Entity.Vessel

Columns to drop due to duplicated information.

1.  City_name with City_id
2.  Region_name with Region_id
3.  Point_name with Point_id
4.  Data_author with city_name
:::

-   **Discussion point #2:** [Handling nested list within data tables.]{.underline}

::: callout-tip
## Decision

For Entity.Region.Point, nested list include:

-   Activities in region (e.g., Commercial fishing, Deep Sea Fishing)

-   Fish species in Region (e.g.,Wrasse/Labridae n.refert, Beauvoir/Habeas pisces)
:::

-   **Discussion point #3:** [Handling unique columns for certain entity tables.]{.underline}

::: callout-tip
## Decision

Event.Transponder,Ping: To determine meaning of “Key”
:::

-   **Discussion point #4:** [Possible calculated fields]{.underline}

::: callout-note
## Decision

For “Event.Transponder.Ping”: Aggregate the dwell time per vessel per ping source to identify time that the vessel spent most.

[For “Event.Transaction”:]{.underline}

1.  Identify cargo with illegal fish species
2.  Match possible regions where fish can be fished vs city_name where the ship has been to see if there’s any overlap for illegal fishing.
:::

Team also discussed the possible connection between the different data table. This can be used as a basis to draw the preliminary knowledge graph used for visualisation of relationship between the various nodes.

Team discussed possible visualisation to explore:

-   **Visualisation #1:** Distribution of fish species captured by the respective vessel companies.

[Subsequent steps:]{.underline}

1.  Identifying companies that deviate from the norm

2.  Identifying companies that have uncommon or suspicious fish species.

-   **Visualisation #2:** Interactive data-table to return the list of cargos and the vessels at the ports by specifying the date and selected port.

-   **Visualisation #3:** Vessel movement, zooming into South Seafood Express Corp

[Subsequent steps]{.underline}:

-   Identifying the common regions that vessel move.

-   Identifying common areas where fishing occurs & dwell time.

-   **Visualisation #4:** Diving into the time spent by vessels at the respective areas to identify vessels that have over-stayed in areas where fishing is not allowed (e.g., Ghoti Reserve)
