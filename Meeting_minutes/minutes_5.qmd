**Date:** 28 May 2024

**Time:** 2pm – 3pm

**Location:** Online – Teams Meeting

**Attendees:** Arya Siahaan, Seng Jing Yi, Thet Myat Noe

**Agenda:**

1.  Discussion on what constitute as illegal fishing.
2.  Discussion on improvements to existing visualisation.
3.  Clarification with Prof Kam

**Meeting Notes:**

Team discussed possible signs of illegal fishing, which includes:

-   Fishing for illegal fish species.

-   Fishing in ecological preserves.

Adding to Prof Kam’s suggestions of considering **IUU – Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing**, the team will be exploring the following:

| IUU                                                                                                                                   | Possible visualisations                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Illegal:** Unauthorised fishing by vessels that are not given the permission to fish from a particular country.                     | Identifying “Unknown” vessels and activities of vessels that are not registered with “Oceanus” flag.                                                         |
| **Unreported**: Fishing activities that are not reported or under-reported to ports which hampers accurate assessment of fish stocks. | Identify vessels that have been identified by transponder ping and port report, but consistently not reporting or under-reporting the volume of fish caught. |
| **Unregulated**: Overfishing that depletes natural fish stocks and disrupts marine ecosystems.                                        | Identify vessels that have consistently out-perform comparable peers, and potentially suggest fishing beyond allowable limits.                               |

With Prof Kam’s suggestions of cross-referencing to summons issued for over-fishing based on articles given in Mini-challenge 1, we filtered out the articles with key words of “overfishing”, “summons”, “police”, “illegal”.

Drilling into mini-challenge 2, sub-question 1, the team surfaced challenges mapping the vessels and cargo at each port based on the individual date. As illustrated in the data table below, the count of vessel and cargo at each port on the same date varies.

![](images/clipboard-2591133048.png)

**Possible reason:** This may be due to variance in time needed to offload cargo, refuel the ships at the respective ports.

Moreover, fishing models needs to be considered such as the use of “Transhipment Vessels” where fishing vessel deposit their catch onto cargo vessels with attempt to maximise fishing time in sea.

Reference: <https://www.oceansinc.earth/transshipment>

**Foreseeable challenges** include different styles that fishing vessels corporate with cargo vessels. Such as:

1.  Same company owning both fishing vessels and transhipment vessels.

2.  Individual fisherman cooperating with larger companies for shipment.

On improving existing visualisation, to identify the route taken by vessels, the path taken by each vessel will be reordered by date to identify the usual routes taken. Any deviation of fishing route may prompt further investigation. The sailing route will further be transposed on Oceanus map.

| Further explore visual evidence and dataset to identify signs of illegal fishing                            | Arya, Jing Yi, Myat | 4 June 2024 |
| Work on take-home assignment 3 to map the vessel to cargos and evaluate which method gives the best match.  | Arya, Jing Yi, Myat | 4 June 2024 |

**Agenda for Next Meeting:**

1.   Share discoveries from exploratory data analysis and areas of interest for subsequent investigation.

2.  Decide on which areas to focus on for each team member for Take Home assignment 3 to maximise coverage of possible insights.
