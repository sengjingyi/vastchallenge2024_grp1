**Attempt for visualisation for China Vis:**

-   Plot breakdown of job titles per dimensions

-   Which candidate profile is most in demand – Education & Experience

![](images/clipboard-1349562241.png)

-   Breakdown of opportunities by city and company type à possibly major cities, or cities that specialise in certain area.

-   Following meeting 1’s agreement to explore Mini Challenge 2, team members voiced challenges faced with viewing the data as the json file includes multiple levels, including nested list and overlapping header names.

-   Interim measure for Mini Challenge 2 is to use the extracted files from the “Nodes” and “Edges” data table and segregate into separate tables based on the “Entity.Type” for nodes and “Event.Type” for edges.

**Next steps agreed are as follows:**

-   Explore ways to parse Vast Challenge – Mini Case 2 .json file into readable format for future graph drawing.

-   Exploring ways to use knowledge graphs and other appropriate visualisation methods to visualise interlinked data set within Mini Case 2.

-   Arrange time for consult with Prof on handling data for 2 shortlisted topics.

**Agenda for Next Meeting:**

1.  Action items review from previous meetings.
2.  Go through possible solutions to overcome data extraction, processing from json file.
3.  Go through possible visualisations (e.g., network graphs) for mini case 2 data.
4.  Discuss possible approach for project proposal (Due: 25 May 2024).
