[Discussion on the functionality and areas for improvement for the r Shiny Plots:]{.underline}

-   **Shiny Plot 1:** Interactive Map of Oceanus

![](images/clipboard-2651763297.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Help users understand the location in relation to each other on a map.

1.  Allows users to select type of area that they are interested in (e.g., Fishing Ground).
2.  Allows users to select type of fish species they are interested in to see location of origin.
3.  Allows users to select activities that they are interested in to see the authorized areas to conduct these activities.

## Areas for Improvement

-   **Shiny Plot 2:** Quantity of cargoes received per month

![](images/clipboard-3395787255.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Help users understand the quantity of cargo caught per month for the various species.

1.  Allows users to zoom into their "Port of Interest"
2.  Trend line of month on month change to identify the pattern (increase/ decrease)
:::

::: callout-tip
## Areas for Improvement

1.  Color of "Salmon" to be shifted to a darker yellow for greater visibility
2.  Include mapping of possible vessels that delivered these cargo & association with the companies that delivered these cargo.
3.  Enforce a "0" reference line for the month on month change to highlight instances where the decrease was negative.
4.  Introduce trend line of "Median" across the year to show the relative catch amount difference for the respective months. (TBC - Quarter?)
:::

-   **Shiny Plot 3:** Network Graph of Vessel ID to Cargo ID mapping

![](images/clipboard-573523213.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Helps users to identify the cargo associated with the vessel of interest.

1.  Allows users to filter to identify the cargo mapping and vessel mapping per company.
2.  Allows user to see the summary of cargo and vessels mapped for each port.
3.  Size of the nodes for cargo is dependent on the cargo quantity in tons.
4.  Color of the cargo node reflects if the fish species caught is legal or illegal. (Red: Illegal, Orange: Legal).
:::

::: callout-tip
## Area for Improvement

1.  Include reference on what is the selected fish species for user's readability.
2.  Include details on which port are these cargo delivered to and which months these cargo are delivered on a summary plot.
:::

-   **Shiny Plot 4:** Vessel dwell time & relative dwell time to other vessels

-   **Shiny Plot 5:** Interactive Calendar Heatmap

![](images/clipboard-1815329463.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Helps user see the seasonality of when cargo reaches the respective ports based on a calendar map

1.  Allows users to compare the cargo count across various port at specific dates.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Area for Improvement

1.  Include filter to allow users to zoom into selected dates of interest.
2.  Relabel of the y axis to make it reasonable instead of using count of weeks.
3.  To include reference to other data set (e.g., Count of vessels that is at the port, return the breakdown of fish species caught)
:::

-   **Shiny Plot 6:** Summary of the most frequent route taken by vessels.

![](images/clipboard-983093079.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Identifies the most travelled distinct routes by vessel.

1.  Allow users to select areas of interest that they are looking at and count the number of vessel for these top routes.
2.  Allow users to zoom into specific companies to identify the distinct locations visited.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Area for Improvement

1.  Highlight routes that have trespass illegal fishing route in "Red"
2.  Highlight routes that have visited fishing grounds and deep sea fishing navigation buoy in "Dark blue"
3.  Include reference to map to plot the geographical route taken on the map.
:::

-   **Shiny Plot 7:** Box Plot of Cargo Weight by Fish Species by Month

![](images/clipboard-4282198763.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Helps users to identify which vessel contributes to which cargo and the relative position within the month.

1.  Allows users to drill down into desired fish species
2.  Allows users to drill down into specific port of interest.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Area for Improvement

1.  Handling error where there is no record for that fish species for the given port, to properly return "No Available Record".
2.  Introduce option for user to select color for highlighted vessels (Multiple) to contrast
:::

-   **Shiny Plot 8:** Median Dwell Time of vessel by Area

![](images/clipboard-1021577931.png)

::: callout-note
## Purpose & Functionality

Purpose: Helps users identify the monthly median dwell time of the vessel at the respective area of interest.

1.  Allows users to identify area that they want to contrast to see the median dwell time spent
2.  Allows users to zoom into specific vessels of interest
3.  By hovering on the plot, users are able to see the name of the vessel id contributing to this median dwell time at the area of interest.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Area for Improvement

1.  Introduce filter to identify vessel by company
2.  Introduce option for user to select color for highlighted vessels (Multiple) to contrast
3.  Introduce reference line that maps the % increase / decrease for month on month median dwell time changes for all vessels & selected vessels.
4.  Introduce data table that returns the vessels and their details for those that are included in the "Highlighted Vessel ID"
:::

-   **Shiny Plot 9:** Route taken by vessels - SOS Myat!

-   **Shiny Plot 10:** Dwell time by vessels at the areas visited - SOS Myat!

-   **Shiny Plot 11:** Comparison of fish delivered month on month with % change - SOS Myat!
